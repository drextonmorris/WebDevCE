        <h2>July</h2>

        <h3>Mountain biking</h3>
        <p>I was riding my bike and flying down the jumps and crashed. It was a terrible crash and I was <br>rushed to the hospital.
            Everything turned out to be okay and I was perfectly fine from it.</p>

        <h3>Boating</h3>
        <p>Riding on a tube, with tons of speed, I was thrown and tossed aside. My knee buckled and I <br>strained my MCL. I was out 
            of football for around two months without training. </p>

        <h2>August</h2>

        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p>We had our first success and was able to win a game. We are 1-1 now and having a great time. <br>It's a blast with my teamates
            and they make it such a fun time being around them. They make <br> it bearable and end up being super fun as well. </p>

        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>We just started school. I'm a senior and have a full schedule and not many friends in my classes. <br>I took different classes
            from what they did and now I'm kind of lonely without them. It would be <br>much funner if I had them in my class to make it 
            enjoyable but it will be a long time with it. </p>

        <h2>April</h2>

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p>With a tournament happening, I try my best to be a part of everything but I can't be everywhere <br>at once. I try my best and it
            still is difficlt, just with it all. </p>

        <h3>Driving</h3>
        <p>Driving a car and heading down the canyon feeling like I'm racing, when I only drive a corolla <br>and can't actually go that fast. 
            Having a fun time but staying within the rules.
