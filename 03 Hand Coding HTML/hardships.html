        <h2>Hardships of Football</h2>
        <p>A lot of people see the touchdowns, the hype, the celebrations—but they don't always see the grind behind football. This sport demands everything from you: your time, your body, your mind. The commitment is real. Early morning lifts, late-night film sessions, practices in the freezing cold or blazing heat—it's nonstop. And the physical toll? Brutal. Your body gets wrecked. Sprains, bruises, concussions, torn muscles—you learn to play through pain like it's normal. But the hardest part might be mental. The pressure to perform, the fear of messing up, the stress of balancing school, life, and football—it can mess with your head. There are days you feel like quitting, but you don't. Because deep down, you know the struggle is part of the story. Football teaches you to fight through adversity, to keep showing up even when it hurts. And that's why, despite all the hardships, I still love this game with everything I've got.</p>

        <p>People think football is just a fall sport, but honestly, it's a year-round grind. The season might run from August to November, but the work never stops. As soon as the last game ends, we're already prepping for next year—off-season training, weightlifting, conditioning, and spring ball. Summer is packed with team camps, 7-on-7 tournaments, and playbook installs. Even when we're not in pads, we're watching film, studying formations, and staying in shape. There's no real “break” if you're serious about it. Football becomes part of your lifestyle, and every month has its own kind of hustle. You don't just play football—you live it. </p>
